# ![Logo](/media/Logo.png) &nbsp; SFPEG **Mass Action** Component

## Introduction

This component displays an actionable data table within a CRM Analytics Dashboard, letting the
user remain in the Dashboard to execute a mass action on this result set.

It leverages the standard  **[slds-datatable](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/component-library/bundle/lightning-datatable)** Lightning base component to display the list of values and provide various unitary/mass update, subfilters... on a copy of the input query results to trigger Apex actions with the resulting list.

![sfpegMassActionCmp in action](/media/sfpegMassAction.png)

When executing one of the proposed action, a form is presented to the user to ask for additional input and/or confirmation before executing it.

![sfpegMassActionCmp interaction](/media/sfpegMassActionMainActionPopup.png)

Typical use case is to leverage a CRM Analytics Dashboard embedded within a Campaign Lightning record page to target Contacts to be added to it as CampaignMembers. This enables the user to remain within the Campaign page (no VF page redirection).

Other use cases are mass reassignment of Accounts to new Owners (with possibly complex filters provided in the Dashboard), mass creation of callback or escalation tasks on Opportunities or Cases... possibly amending information on the selected records before executing the operation.

**⚠️ This component is still in early beta state**. It works fine but has not been used yet on production environments.
It aims at completely replacing the component provided by the **[PEG_TCRM](https://github.com/pegros/PEG_TCRM)** package by providing the following added value:
* LWC instead of Aura implementation (better performances)
* more native support of the CRM Analytics capabilities (data are produced by the Dashboard and injected into the component vs reverse engineering of the current filter state to generate a SAQL query to re-fetch the data)
* native usage within CRM Analytices and not only for Dashboards embedded within Lightning pages.

## Component Overview

### Main Action Processing

A typical use case is to start from a main Dashboard enabling to filter various Salesforce core data and
display important related KPIs.
From this dashboard, various action buttons (here isolated on the top right) enable to access
special Dashboard tabs hidden from the standard navigation.

![Navigation Entry](/media/sfpegMassActionEntry.png)

When clicking on one action button (e.g. "Add to Campaign" / "Ajout Campagne"), an action dedicated tab is 
displayed to the user, with the list of records eligible to the action (provided by the Dashboard according
to the filters applied).

![Main Action Screen](/media/sfpegMassActionStep1.png)

From this page, the user selects the actual records on which the action should be applied (_select all_ option
being possible). The user may also sort them to check possible issues and unselect special records.

When triggering the actual operation (brand color header button), a 4 step process is launched
1. eligibility control of the selected records (optional), e.g. to filter out records already processed  
2. information entry (optional) and action confirmation
3. action execution (progressive in batches)
4. action execution summary


Typically, after having selected rows and triggered the operation, the (optional) filtering happens
and the step #2 popup form gets displayed. 

![Action Confirmation Screen](/media/sfpegMassActionStep2.png)

Once the user enters the required data and confirms the operation, the execution is launched and 
a progress bar is displayed.

![Action Execution Screen](/media/sfpegMassActionStep3.png)

Once all records have been processed a summary of the operation is presented, with details about failures vs 
succcesses.

![Action Summary Screen](/media/sfpegMassActionStep4.png)

After having closed the operation popup, the user gets back to the original list, with status information
for each processed record.

![Main Action Screen with Status Display](/media/sfpegMassActionStep5.png)


### Local Action Processing

Before actually launching the operation, it is possible to rework somehow the records presented in the 
main data table via additional local header buttons (displayed in neutral instead of brand variant).
These modifications apply only locally on the data displayed in the component (i.e. not in Salesforce
core database nor in CRM Analytics one) but will be used when executing the main operation.

This enables to prepare data in a more targeted way than with the main action form (at step #2) and even 
roll back to the original configuration.

Typically, after having selected rows and triggered the local operation, a popup form gets displayed. 

![Local Action Form Screen](/media/sfpegMassActionLocalStep2.png)

Once the user enters the required data (here a Task subject and due date) and confirms the local
operation, the records are updated and their status updated.

![Main Action Screen with Local Action Status](/media/sfpegMassActionLocalStep3.png)

Afterwards, when executing the main action, the updated information on the records (here the subject 
and due date of Tasks to create) is primarily used and the row status gets further updated.

![Main Action Screen with Main Action Status](/media/sfpegMassActionLocalStep5.png)


### Component Access Control

The access to the component in the Dashboard may be simply controlled via **Custom Permissions**.

If a **Custom Permission** name is set in the Action configuration, any user not having it in their
permissions will get an access error message.

![Action Access Denied](/media/sfpegMassActionPermissionControl.png)

## Component Configuration

Configuration of this component is done at two levels:
* in the **Analytics Studio** Dashboard editor, mainly consisting in standard data **query** configuration
* via **sfpegMassAction** custom metadata records for display and action configuration

A standard / default **sfpegMassActionSoqlDml_SVC** Apex class is available to execute standard SOQL
based controls and DML (insert / update / delete) operations. If needed, custom filter / action logic
may be added in Apex (by implementing the **sfpegMassAction_SVC** virtual class interface) and used in
this configuration.

### Analytics Studio Configuration

After having selected the **SFPEG Mass Action** component in the Dashboard editor, 
the underlying Query needs to be configured first. It is possible to come back
any time to the query via the standard query editor action (shown in red below).

![sfpegMassActionCmp Query Configuration](/media/sfpegMassActionConfig1.png)

**⚠️ Beware** to select at least one dimension uniquely identifying the rows to be
displayed in the data table. Otherwise row selection will fail when using the
component if duplicates are found !

This unique key dimension must then be set in the `Key Field`property when
opening the _Component Attributes_ (shown in blue below).

![sfpegMassActionCmp Component Configuration](/media/sfpegMassActionConfig2.png)

The second most important property is then `Configuration` which should provide
the Developer Name of the **sfpegMassAction** metadata record providing the 
most detailed configuration.

Other properties enable to:
* set a title content and size 
* provide contextual information about a specific record, e.g. leveraging
dynamic bindings to provide the `Object Name` and `Record ID` of a selected 
record elsewhere in the Dashboard or of the page record when embedding the
Dashboard in a Lightning record page.
* activate debug logs in the console

### **Metadata** Configuration

Most of the detailed configuration is done in **sfpegMassAction** custom
metadata records.

![sfpegMassActionCmp Metadata Configuration](/media/sfpegMassActionConfigMeta.png)

This configuration consists into 5 the main areas:
* **General** information
* **[Context](#component-context)** data
* **[Display](#display-configuration)** configuration
* **[Filter](#data-filtering-setting)** setting (for main action)
* **[Main Action](#main-action-definition)** definition

#### General Information

This section mainly provides mainly naming and description of the **sfpegMassAction** custom metadata record.

It also includes the optional `Permission` property enabling to control user access to the metadata record.
If set, only Users with the specified Custom Permission may access the record, enabling to enforce
**[Component Access Control](#component-access-control)** in the Dashboard.

####  Component Context

This section defines the information required by the various actions (and optional filter) to
contextualise the execution to the current user, date...

A single (optional) `Context` property is provided, which, when set, should contain a stringified
JSON object defining
* the names of the different context properties to be used
* their values in a static or dynamic way

When opting for dynamic values, each property should be set as a JSON object in `{"origin":"source"}` global format.
* the origin may be the **current User**, in which case the source should be the API name
of the User field to be used (e.g. `{"userField":"Email"}`)
* the origin may be the **current record** if the **Object Name**  and **Record Id** properties 
have been set in the **[Analytics Studio](#analytics-studio-configuration)** configuration, in which case the source
should be the API name of the Object field to be used (e.g. `{"recordField":"Name"}`)
* the origin may be **automatic**, in which case the source should have one of the following values:
    * `userId` to get the current User Id (e.g. `{"automatic":"userId}`)
    * `objectApiName` or `recordId` to fetch the corresponding information from the current record
    (if the Analytics Studio properties have been set, see above)
    * `now` to fetch the current timestamp
    * `today`, `tomorrow`, `yesterday`, `nextWeek`, `lastWeek`, `nextMonth`, `lastMonth`, `nextQuarter`,
    `lastQuarter`, `nextYear`, `lastYear` to fetch date values relative to the current day

As an example, the following context value would provide the current user ID, his name and email,
the name of the current record, the date one week from today and a fixed "P2" task priority value.
```
{
    "UserId":       {"automatic":"userId"},
    "UserName":     {"userField":"Name"},
    "UserEmail":    {"userField":"Email"},
    "RecordName":   {"recordField":"Name"},
    "TargetDate":   {"automatic":"nextWeek"},
    "TaskPriority": "P2"
}
```

#### Display Configuration

This section mainly defines the way data provided by the Dashboard should be presented in the datatable.
It also sets how the main action should be displayed and configures which additional _[local](#local-action-processing)_
actions may be available.


The `Display Config` property provides the configuration of the underlying
**[lightning-datatable](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/component-library/bundle/lightning-datatable/documentation)**
component and consists in a stringified JSON configuration object (see standard documentation for details
especially about the `columns`property).
    
As an example, the following configuration enables to select max 100 records in a datatable displaying
5 columns with 4 fields from the rows provided by the Dashboard and 1 technical `_status` managed by the
component.
```
{
    "hideCheckboxColumn": false,
    "maxRowSelection": 100,
    "columns": [
        {   "label":"Code postal",  "fieldName":"Code_postal",  "sortable":true,
            "cellAttributes": {"class":{"fieldName":"_color"}}},
        {   "label":"Département",  "fieldName":"Code_departement", "sortable":true,
            "cellAttributes": {"class":{"fieldName":"_color"}}},
        {   "label":"Nombre",   "fieldName":"count",    "type":"number",    "sortable":true},
        {   "label":"Valeur foncière",  "fieldName":"sum_Valeur_fonciere",  "type":"number",    "sortable":true},
        {   "fieldName":"_status",  "type":"text",  "sortable":true,
            "cellAttributes": { "iconName":{"fieldName":"_icon"},"iconPosition": "right",
                                "title":{"fieldName":"_message"}},
            "initialWidth": 100,"iconName": "utility:stage","hideLabel": true}
    ]
}
```

The `Action Label`, `Action Title` and `Action Message` properties then enables to set the main action
button label and define the title and help message of the displayed action popup.

At last, the `Display Actions` property defines the set of _[local](#local-action-processing)_ actions to be provided
in addition to the main one, as a stringified JSON list of action configuration objects, consisting in:
    * a `label` for button display and `name` for action unique identification
    * a `title` and `message` for the action popup header title and main message
    * a `type`, i.e. `update` for field updates on the selected rows or `reset` to reset the selected
    rows to their orginal states
    * `status`, `icon` and `color` (optional) properties to update the corresponding technical fields
    * a `form` to define the content of the action popup form in terms of fields proposed for user input
    (see main action section below for more details)
    * a `template` to define the set of fields to be set/updated on the selected rows as well as the
    origin of their values (see main action section below for more details)
For the last two properties, please refer to the [main action](#main-action-definition) section for details
as configuration principles are identical.

The following configuration example defines 3 actions,
* the first resetting the selected records,
* the second simply updating the technical status of the selected rows (to a fixed custom _excluded_ value),
* the last updating the _Subject_ of selected records with the Name entered in a form (and updating the 
status to _updated_ value)

```
[
    {   "label":"Reset",    "name":"reset", "type":"reset",
        "title":"Roll-back to initial state",
        "message":"Confirm to undo all changes!"},
    {   "label":"Exclude",  "name":"exclude",   "type":"update",
        "title":"Mark as excluded",
        "status":"excluded",    "icon":"standard:record_delete",    "color":"slds-text-color_error"},
    {   "label":"Change Subject", "name":"changeSubject",   "type":"update",
        "title":"Modify Subject",
        "status":"updated", "icon":"custom:custom18",   "color":"slds-text-color_success",
        "form":{    "objectApiName":"TaskProxy__c", "size":12,
                    "fields": [{"name":"Name","required":true}] },
        "template":{"form":{"Subject":"Name"}}}
]
```

#### Data Filtering Setting

When executing the [main action](#main-action-processing), it is possible to first execute a filtering
of the selected rows prior to the actual action execution. This enables to cope with the data synchronisation
latency between CRM Analytics and Salesforce core platform and prevent users from creating multiple
redundant records. Alternatively, a _best effort_ mode action execution may also cope with such issues
(redundant records being rejected upon insert).

A main `Filter?` boolean property enables to easily control the activation of this feature.

When the feature is activated, the following properties must be defined:
* `Filter Class` to define the Apex class implementing the filter logic
    * default value being the **[sfpegMassActionSoqlDml](#default-apex-logic)** class provided
    with the package and implementing a simple SOQL based logic
* `Filter Batch Size` to execute the filtering in a progressive paginated way to cope with possible
size limitations
    * default value `0` meaning no pagination
* `Filter Template` to define the mapping betweeen the row identification property on the selected rows
and the identification field in the filter logic result set
    * It is defined as a JSON Object with `source` and `target` properties identifying the 2 fields
    * e.g. `{"source":"PersonContactId","target":"ContactId"}` to match Contact IDs between a
    PersonAccount in a CRM Analytics dataset and a CampaignMember in Salesforce core database.
* `Filter Config` to provide additional configuration information to the filter Apex class
    * e.g. the SOQL query template to execute when using the **[sfpegMassActionSoqlDml](#default-apex-logic)**
    class

#### Main Action Definition

This section defines the way the main action should be executed and relies on the following
properties:
* `Action Class` to define the Apex class implementing the action execution logic
    * default value being the **[sfpegMassActionSoqlDml](#default-apex-logic)** class provided
    with the package and implementing a simple DML based logic
* `Action Batch Size` to execute the ection in a progressive paginated way to cope with possible
size limitations
    * default value `0` meaning no pagination
* `Action Form` (optional) to configure an entry form to capture data from user to be applied
to all selected records prior to action execution
* `Action Template` to define the data to be actually sent as input to the Apex execution logic,
as a JSON object definining how to merge information coming from one of the following sources
    * `base` for a static base set of data to use  
    * `form` for fields coming from the action form
    * `context` for fields coming from the [component context](#component-context)
    * `row` for dynamic fields coming from each processed row
```
{
    "base":{
        "sobjectType":"Task"
    },
    "form": {
        "ActivityDate":"ActivityDate__c"
    },
    "row": {
        "Subject": "CalculatedSubject"
    },
    "context": {
        "OwnerId": "UserId",
        "Status": "TaskOpenStatus",
        "Priority": "TaskPriority"
    }
}
```
* `Action Config` to provide additional configuration information to the action Apex class
    * e.g. the DML type (such as `insert` or `insertBE`) when using the **[sfpegMassActionSoqlDml](#default-apex-logic)**
    class

### Apex Logic Implementation

In both **[Data Filtering Setting](#data-filtering-setting)** and **[Main Action Definition](#main-action-definition)**
properties of the **sfpegMassAction** custom metadata records, the names of the Apex classes implementing the logic
to apply need to be explicitly provided. 

These may be any Apex classes extending the **sfpegMassAction_SVC** virtual class and providing implementation 
respectively for its `filterRows()` or `executeAction()` methods.

As a baseline the **sfpegMassActionSoqlDml** Apex class is provided with the package to support:
* **SOQL based filtering** of rows to be processed (to remove the selected rows that are present in the 
results of a SOQL query)
* insert/update/delete **DML operations** with the selected rows (in _all-or-none_ or _best effort_ mode)

#### Default SOQL Filter Logic (**sfpegMassActionSoqlDml**)

For row filtering, the configuration consists in :
* activating the `Filter ?` boolean checkbox
* keeping **sfpegMassActionSoqlDml** as `Filter Class`
* fill in the `Filter Template` with a stringified JSON object containing
    * the `source` field on the selected rows to be used as criteria in the query (e.g. the `PersonContactId`
    of a list of ***Accounts***)
    * the `target` field on the SOQL query results matching it (e.g. the `ContactId`of the set of of ***CampaignMembers***)
    ```
    {
        "source": "PersonContactId",
        "target": "ContactId"
    }
    ```
* registering the SOQL query to execute in the `Filter Config` property, leveraging `{{{ROWS}}}`
and ```{{{CTX.xxx}}}` tokens to contextualise the query respectively with the `source`field 
values of the selected records and the global `Context` parameters defined.
    * e.g. to remove the ***CampaignMembers*** already defined on a given ***Campaign*** for the selected ***PersonAccounts***,
    with `Context` set to `{"CampaignId":"recordId"}` in the **sfpegMassAction** record and the `recordId` defined on the component configuration parameters in the Dashboard (e.g. leveraging dynamic bindings)
    ```
    select ContactId from CampaignMember where CampaignId = '{{{CTX.CampaignId}}}' and ContactId in ({{{ROWS}}})
    ```
* In any case, all filtered out rows are then tagged as `Excluded` in the component.


#### Default DML Action Logic (**sfpegMassActionSoqlDml**)

For action execution, the configuration consists in :
* keeping **sfpegMassActionSoqlDml** as `Action Class`
* filling in the `Action Template` with the target Object record content for the DML operation, i.e. including
at least a `sobjectType` property and any other field API Name of this Object (with a first capital letter), e.g.
```
{
    "base":{
        "sobjectType":"Task",
        "RecordTypeId":"{{{RT.Task.ClientAssociateTask}}}"
    },
    "form": {
        "ActivityDate":"ActivityDate__c",
    },
    "row": {
        "WhoId":"PersonContactId"
    },
    "context": {
        "OwnerId":"UserId",
        "WhatId": "RecordId"
    }
}
```
* registering the DML operation to execute in the `Action Config` property
    * `insert`, `update`, `delete` for the corresponding DML in _all-or-nothing_ mode (i.e. ending as soon as
    there is an issue and executing a rollback on the row selection batch being processed)
    * `insertBE`, `updateBE` or `deleteBE` for the same operations in _best-effort_ mode (i.e. iterating until
    the end of the entire row selection, committing all possible changes)
    * In any case, all processed rows are then tagged as `Processed`or `Failed` in the component.

#### Apex Logic Extension

These may be any Apex classes extending the **sfpegMassAction_SVC** virtual class and providing implementation 
respectively for its `filterRows()` or `executeAction()` methods.

The standard **sfpegMassActionSoqlDml** class provides a default implementation for the 
record **filtering** and action **execution**.

It is however possible to replace this baseline logic by implementing any Apex
class extending the virtual **sfpegMassAction_SVC** class and providing actual
logic for any of the two `filterRows()` or `executeAction()` available methods.

The standard **sfpegMassActionSoqlDml** provides an example of such an implementation.

in the **sfpegMassAction** custom metadata record, it is possible to register two distinct
Apex classes respectively for the `Filter Class` and `Action Class` properties.
It is therefore possible to still leverage the default **sfpegMassActionSoqlDml** implementation
for only one of the two logics.

## Configuration Examples

🚧 to be completed....


## Technical Details
### Row Status Properties

When executing operations, various technical fields are automatically set on the rows by the component,
which may then be displayed in the component (see **[Display](#display-configuration)** Configuration) to provide
feedback to the user:
* `_status` is a general status
* `_icon` provides a [SLDS utility icon](https://www.lightningdesignsystem.com/icons/) name corresponding to the status
* `_color` provides a [SLDS text color class](https://www.lightningdesignsystem.com/utilities/text/) name corresponding to the status
* `_message` provides additional information about the status (e.g. an error message)

These technical fields may also be set via the _local_ actions (see **[Display Configuration](#display-configuration)**)

### RecordType Handling

In multiple complex JSON based configuration properties of the he **sfpegMassAction** custom metadata,
record types may be referenced by ***tokens*** instead of hard coded IDs. These tokens are then 
automatically replaced by their actual IDs when the component loads the applicable metadata record.

The syntax to adopt is `{{{RT.ObjectApiName.RecordTypeDevName}}}` which may be used in the 
`Context`, `Display Actions`, `Action Form` and `Action Template` properties.

E.g. in the following `Action Form` property, in order to filter the set of picklist values
according to a specific record type, the applicable record type ID may be specified as follows.
```
{
    "message":"Please provide task details.",
    "objectApiName":"TaskProxy__c",
    "RecordTypeId":"{{{RT.TaskProxy__c.Commercial}}}",
    "size":12,
    "fields": [
        {"name":"Reason__c","required":true},
        {"name":"ActivityDate__c","required":true}
    ]
}
```

### Custom Labels

Various custom labels are used by the component and may be modified / translated via standard Salesforce
setup screens. All applicable labels are prefixed with ***sfpegMassAction***.

**⚠️ Beware** not to override your configuration when deploying new versions of the component !

### Technical Framework

This component relies on the standard **[lightning-datatable](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/component-library/bundle/lightning-datatable/documentation)** component for data display.
All of the data display configuration of the **sfpegMassActionCmp** component directly depend on the capabilities
of this base component.

Forms displayed in the component rely on the standard **[lightning-record-edit-form](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/component-library/bundle/lightning-record-edit-form/documentation)** component in creation mode.
Therefore, only objects supported by this component may be used, thus requiring the use of 
_Custom Proxy Objects_ in certain cases (e.g. for _Tasks_ as shown in some examples).
