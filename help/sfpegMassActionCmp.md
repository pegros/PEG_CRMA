# SFPEG Mass Action Component
---

## Introduction

This component displays an actionable data table within a CRM Analytics Dashboard, letting the
user remain in the Dashboard to execute a mass action on this result set.

It leverages the standard  **[slds-datatable](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/component-library/bundle/lightning-datatable)** Lightning base component to display the list of values and provide various unitary/mass update, subfilters... on a copy of the input query results to trigger Apex actions with the resulting list.

When executing one of the proposed action, a form is presented to the user to ask for additional input and/or confirmation before executing it.

![sfpegMassActionCmp interaction](/media/sfpegMassActionMainActionPopup.png)

Typical use case is to leverage a CRM Analytics Dashboard embedded within a Campaign Lightning record page to target Contacts to be added to it as CampaignMembers. This enables the user to remain within the Campaign page (no VF page redirection).

Other use cases are mass reassignment of Accounts to new Owners (with possibly complex filters provided in the Dashboard), mass creation of callback or escalation tasks on Opportunities or Cases... possibly amending information on the selected records before executing the operation.

**‚ö†Ô∏è This component is still in early beta state**. It works but has not been used yet on production environments. It aims at completely replacing the component provided by the **[PEG_TCRM](https://github.com/pegros/PEG_TCRM)** package byproviding the following added value:
* LWC instead of Aura implementation (better performances)
* more native support of the CRM Analytics capabilities (data are produced by the Dashboard and injected into the component vs reverse engineering of teh current filter state to generate a SAQL query to re-fetch the data)
* native usage within CRM Analytices and not only for Dashboards embedded within Lightning pages.

## Component Overview

### Typical Use Case

A main Dashboard enables to filter various core data and display important related KPIs.
From this dashboard, various action buttons (here isolated on the top right) enable to access
special Dashboard tabs hidden from the standard navigation.
![Navigation Entry](/media/sfpegMassActionEntry.png)

When clicking on one action button (e.g. "Add to Campaign" / "Ajout Campagne"), an action dedicated tab is 
displayed to the user, with the list of records eligible to the action (provided by the Dashboard according
to the filters applied).

![Main Action Screen](/media/sfpegMassActionStep1.png)

From this page, the user selects the actual records on which the action should be applied (_select all_ option
being possible). The user may also sort them to check possible issues and unselect special records.

When triggering the actual operation (brand color header button), a 4 step process is launched
1. eligibility control of the selected records (optional), e.g. to filter out records already processed  
2. information entry (optional) and action confirmation
3. action execution (progressive in batches)
4. action execution summary


Typically, after having triggered the operation, the (optional) filtering happens and the step #2 popup
form gets displayed.

Once the user enters the required data and confirms the operation, the execution is launched and 
a progress bar is displayed.

Once all records have been processed a summary of the operation is presented, with details about failures vs 
succcesses.

After having closed the operation popup, the user gets back to the original list, with status information
for each processed record.

### Main Action Processing

The component displays a main action to be applied on the Salesforce core database via an Apex action.

There are actually two steps

## Component Configuration

Configuration of this component is done at two levels:
* in the **Analytics Studio** Dashboard editor, mainly consisting in standard data **query** configuration
* via **sfpegMassAction** custom metadata records for display and action configuration

A standard / default **sfpegMassActionSoqlDml_SVC** Apex class is available to execute standard SOQL
based controls and DML (insert / update / delete) operations. If needed, custom filter / action logic
may be added in Apex (by implementing the **sfpegMassAction_SVC** virtual class interface) and used in
this configuration.

### **Analytics Studio** Configuration

After having selected the **SFPEG Mass Action** component in the Dashboard editor, 
the underlying Query needs to be configured first. It is possible to come back
any time to the query via the standard query editor action (shown in red below).

**Beware** to select at least one dimension uniquely identifying the rows to be
displayed in the data table. Otherwise row selection will fail when using the
component if duplicates are found !

This unique key dimension must then be set in the `Key Field`property when
opening the _Component Attributes_ (shown in blue below).

The second most important property is then `Configuration` which should provide
the Developer Name of the **sfpegMassAction** metadata record providing the 
most detailed configuration.

Other properties enable to:
* set a title content and size 
* provide contextual information about a specific record, e.g. leveraging
dynamic bindings to provide the Object Name and record ID of a selected 
record elsewhere in the Dashboard or of the page record when embedding the
Dashboard in a Lightning record page.
* activate debug logs in the console
### **Metadata** Configuration

Most of the detailed configuration is done in **sfpegMassAction** custom
metadata records.
