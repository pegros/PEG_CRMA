# SFPEG Planning Component
---


## Introduction

The **sfpegPlanningCmp** component was initially implemented to display a planning of all Campaigns
active upon a given period. It takes a list elements as input and enables to display it as bars:
* leveraging a start / end date or timestamp field
* applying a color dynamically or based on a field
* possibly separating bars via a grouping field

The component is displayed hereafter in the red rectangle, Campaigns being grouped here by RecordType and
coloured by Status.

The component is highly dynamic, in terms of axis sizing, scrollbar activation...
It leverages the latest `D3.js` library to automatically display the bars and time axis.

**This component is still in early beta state.** It works but is still not fully tested in real 
production environments.
